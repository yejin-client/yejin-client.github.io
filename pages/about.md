# **About Me**

<!-- Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}** :wave:,<br> -->
Hi, I am Vishal! :wave:,<br>

I am currently working as a Software Engineer at the [Simulation-Based System Design Laboratory](https://enme.umd.edu/research/simulation-based-system-design-laboratory) for [Institute for Systems Research](https://isr.umd.edu/), University of Maryland College Park to develop tools that accelerate simulation-based testing and verification to provide assurance for performance and robustness of AI and Autonomous Multi-Agent Systems.

I graduated from the University of Maryland College Park with a [Master of Science in Systems Engineering](https://isr.umd.edu/education/msse-degree) degree. I recently defended my thesis dissertation on [Experimental Design using Bayesian Belief Network for Simulation-based assurance cases](https://www.proquest.com/docview/2829422368) to determine the optimal experimental design for a simulation. Using Bayesian Networks, I implemented a Bayesian framework that helps understand which areas the experimentation should focus on to achieve successful confidence in the development of assurance cases.

I worked as a Graduate Research Assistant at [Simulation-Based System Design Laboratory](https://enme.umd.edu/research/simulation-based-system-design-laboratory) under [Dr. Jeffrey Herrmann](https://enme.umd.edu/clark/faculty/547/Jeffrey-Herrmann) to implement simulation tools for rapid operational development and testing by developing features for randomized scenario generation and improving the simulator's features and functionalities.

Previously, I completed my integrated Masters of Technology in Electronics and Communication Engineering at [International Institute of Information Technology Bangalore](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/). Previously, I was employed as a Research Associate at [Surgical and Assistive Robotics Lab](https://www.iiitb.ac.in/sarl/sarl.html) led by Prof. Madhav Rao.

My passion lies in software development for robotics systems, and I have worked on several projects in different domains: Simulation, Motion Planning, Computer Vision, and Systems Engineering. My ultimate goal is to become a robotics engineer who specializes in the design and development of robotics systems and enables the transition of robots from simulation to the real world.

My interests lie in the area of Robotics and Game Development. My hobbies include making album art covers and animations using Blender Game Engine.
