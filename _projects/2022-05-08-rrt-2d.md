Rapidly-exploring random trees (RRT) is a common option that both creates a graph and finds a path which may not necessarily be optimal. Points are randomly generated and connected to the closest available node. Each time a vertex is created, a check must be made that the vertex lies outside of an obstacle. Furthermore, chaining the vertex to its closest neighbor must also avoid obstacles. The algorithm ends when a node is generated within the goal region, or a limit is hit.

### Built With
* Python3

# Getting Started

# Prerequisites

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/vishalgattani/Path-Planning.git
   ```
2. Change to PRM
   ```sh
   cd sampling-based/
   ```

# Usage

1. Run the python file:

   ```sh
   python3 rrt_2d.py
   ```


# RRT Algorithm(in progress)
```
Qgoal //region that identifies success
Counter = 0 //keeps track of iterations
lim = n //number of iterations algorithm should run for
G(V,E) //Graph containing edges and vertices, initialized as empty
While counter < lim:
    Xnew  = RandomPosition()
    if IsInObstacle(Xnew) == True:
        continue
    Xnearest = Nearest(G(V,E),Xnew) //find nearest vertex
    Link = Chain(Xnew,Xnearest)
    G.append(Link)
    if Xnew in Qgoal:
        Return G
Return G
```
